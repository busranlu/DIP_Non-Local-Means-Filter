# DIP_Non-Local-Means-Filter
Digital Signal Processing, Non Local Means (NLM) Flter


In this project, non local means filtering algorithm are implemented. This algortihm is tested on noisyImage_Gaussian.jpg and noisyImage_Gaussian_01 that have different gaussian noise levels.  The results compared with Opencv(cv.fastNlMeansDenoising) Non Local Means Filter and Opencv(cv.GaussianBlur) Gaussian Blur Filter. Non Local Means Filtering method gives the best result.
